# CSEC 507: Applied Cryptology Notes
My notes from watching the [CSEC 507: Applied Cryptology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUoixF7agmIvqZtb8XxfOxTuYsuYOrgck) course by [Cihangir Tezcan](https://cihangir.forgottenlance.com/) from [Middle East Technical University](https://www.metu.edu.tr/).

I highly recommend [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and reading these notes offline.
